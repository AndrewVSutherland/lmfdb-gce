Gunicorn Options/Tuning

1. http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/faq.html:

1.1 Increase ulimit:
/etc/security/limits.conf:
*               soft    nofile          65535
*               hard    nofile          65535

1.2 Increase the maximum socket backlog:
/etc/sysctl.conf:
net.core.somaxconn = 2048


2. http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/design.html:

Generally we recommend (2 x $num_cores) + 1 as the number of workers to start off with.

Some examples of behavior requiring asynchronous workers:
        Applications making long blocking calls (Ie, external web services)
        Serving requests directly to the internet
        â€¦

TO DO: AB tests with 'sync' and 'eventlets'+keepalive (i.e. async) workers.
